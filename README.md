### Reflection

#### Overall comments:


#### What I liked: 
* I think the interface turned out well.
* I like the pagination.

#### What I'd improve: 
* I need to figure out how to make the <b>first-time load</b> quicker, likely by splitting up the App.js file into smaller ones.
* I'm curious to see <b>a more optimal algorithm</b> for generating non-random hex codes.
* The <b>shade filters</b> aren't perfect. That is, there are some purples grouped as browns, grays grouped in purples, etc.
* I'd better utilize <b>Bootstrap</b> so I can avoid tedious media queries. 
* I looked at some <b>GraphQL</b> tutorials but decided to leave it out for this project. I'm interested in learning more about it though.
